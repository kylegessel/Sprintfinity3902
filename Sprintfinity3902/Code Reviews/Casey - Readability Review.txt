Overall, the Animation class is written well and is easy to read and follow
along with. All but one method in this class are under five lines of code. This
makes it easy to look at a method and quickly understand its purpose. Also, 
methods and variables are clearly named. Therefore, between the name and lines
of code in each method, it can quickly be determine exactly what will be done 
when the method is called. Finally, the Animation class allows the 
AnimationFrame class to handle setting up each frame for an animation which 
reduces the clutter in the Animation class. 

There are also a couple things that make the Animation class a little harder to
read in specific areas. In the draw method, it makes a call to the spriteBatch 
draw method. This call is almost 160 characters with 9 parameters. Trying to 
read through each parameter and understand its meaning can become challenging 
very quickly. It may be best to have some of these float parameters be named 
variable where their purpose is made more clear. A couple parameters use
multiple dots to access attributes multiple levels down. Initializing these to
other variable may also help it become more readable. The only other area that
is a little more difficult to read is the Update method. Though I believe this 
is the smartest implimentation, having nested if loops can make it slightly 
more difficult to understand what is going on. 

I don't believe their is much that needs to be changed in this class. For the 
most part, it is clear, concise, and written in a manner that is easy to read
and understand.
