Reviewing empahsis: Maintainability

Review:

The player decorator is mainly housed in the SetDamageLinkCommand. This class takes Game as an input and is created in the Game1 class.
It's not very maintainable practice to access public instance variables of a class. The code for a decorator for link makes more sense
to be housed in the Player entity itself. Casey implemented the color feature into the Draw method of each PlayerState so it could
be made more simple by housing the decorator logic in Player itself instead of modifying the Game class. This will also reduce coupling between
the game class and the decorator. Maintainability is somewhat a mute point with the decorator, however, since there will only be one 
decorator class for one purpose. Overall, this is really not bad at all but maybe doesn't need to be its own class. It really only
changes colors of the player for a specificed timer. It was good practice to keep the duration of the decorator a constant in the class
and handle mod operations to make sure any value of the timer would work for the animation.
