Reviewing empahsis: Maintainability

Review:

The player decorator is mainly housed in the SetDamageLinkCommand and DamagedLink classes. The SetDamageLinkCommand class takes Game as an input and is created in the Game1 class.
It's not very maintainable practice to access public instance variables of a class directly. The code for a decorator for link makes more sense
to be housed in the Player entity itself. Casey implemented the color feature into the Draw method of each PlayerState so the decorator could
be made more simple by being housing in the Player itself instead of modifying the Game class. This will also reduce coupling between
the game class and the decorator.

DamagedLink reimplements all of the features of AbstractEntity which defeats the point of that class; it should simply extend AbstractEntity
which is a quick fix. Overall, the DamagedLink class looks practically flawless to my eyes beyond the aforementioned repetition, its simple
and easy to read, and seems easy to maintain.

It was good practice to keep the duration of the decorator as a constant in the class and handle mod operations to make sure any value of the 
timer would work for the animation. Overall, this is semi-maintainable, but should just be restructured into an already existing class.
