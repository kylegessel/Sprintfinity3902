Review:

Casey's shop classes are well written... I'm not going to mess around and type a bunch of paragraphs.
Casey's code is neat, well organized, cohesive for sure. I enjoy that he coded to interfaces. One 
plain critique I have is that Casey shouldn't make the createspritelist method because its body is one
line and it is only called from one other area, thus, it should just live in the other spot and the method 
removed. As I said before there is one reference to it from within the class. With 70 lines of code, and
well-identified static class constants, I would give Casey a 10/10 here.
