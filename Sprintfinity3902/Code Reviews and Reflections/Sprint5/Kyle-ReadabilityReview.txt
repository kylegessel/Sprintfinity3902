The Hand class is one of the most unique enemies in the game! While this enemy
may not appear in the final verison of the game, the code is still very
applicable and a point of future interest if the game were to be developed
further.

Overall, the class is ver readable. Very few methods are involved in this class
and those that are are clearly applicable to the goals of the class.

The abstraction of the AI portion of the Hand into its own seperate class helps
this class a ton. Having that logic within the Hand enemy class itself would
greatly reduce the cohesion of the enemy class. Logic for tracking link is not
inherently applicable to the hand itself, especially since that tracking does
not even indicate how to move, just which direction link is in.

My biggest complaints would be that both the update and the move methods are
quite long and complex. Adding helper methods could possibly reduce these and
make them not only more readable but more maintainable as well.

The hand enemy is so unique, so the class is somewhat doomed to be much more
complex than the logic behind most enemies. Despite that, I think the class is
quite a good implementation.
