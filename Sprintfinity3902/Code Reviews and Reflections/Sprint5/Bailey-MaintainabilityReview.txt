Reviewing empahsis: Maintainability

This sprint, Brad took another look at the FireAttack class to ensure that it worked with more
than just the Aquamentus boss. In this respect, Brad completed exactly what he set out to do!
By ensureing that the FireAttack can work with many different enemy types, he made the class more
usable and maintainable in the long run, skipping the need for specific FireAttack classes for 
different enemies. 

There is one change I would recommend to make the class even more maintainable. For starters,
the class has many constructors, and 4 of them are never used. Although this isn't a huge issue,
it might make the class harder to maintain in the long run. It can be difficult to figure out
which constructor for the FireAttack corresponds with which behavior. If this was more explicitly
stated, it might go a long way in making the class more maintainable in the future becuase anyone 
looking at it again would have a more clear understanding of how it works and know what might need
to be looked at.

Other than that, the class looks very good. Magic numbers are taken care of with detailed names, 
which helps with understanding why they are there, and the variable names are detailed and 
accomplish the same thing. This will help the class be maintained more easily in the long run.
And, I again want to say that making the FireAttack work for any enemy (or even blocks) was 
genuis and makes the class so much more usable and maintainable.

Great job, Brad!
