This class is my favorite of the new bosses that we implemented, so I had to
review it.

I love how all of the mandhandla parts move together as one entity despite
being 5. I like that the central one controls the movement of all of them.
I think this is highly maintainable. Say we changed the movement pattern of the
boss. We would only have to change the movement pattern on this main central
component since each respective part bases their position on this compononet.

Things like the update and draw methods are kept very clean which helps with
maintainability. Hit register is a little complex since it depends on each of
the other components, however I think it is easily maintainable.

Most other components act exactly like a typical enemy. For example, we
set the step size in a very typical way for an enemy. I think this helps to
keep the code maintainable as well.

The least maintainable part that I see would be the boundaries within the move 
function. They decrease moves cohesion and are generally kind of hard to
understand at first glance. 

This a cool class for a really cool enemy. Great work!
