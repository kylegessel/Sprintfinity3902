Reviewing empahsis: Maintainability

The Font Sprite Factory is a well written class. The sprite factory uses the 
Singleton design pattern. I think this class is overal a very maintainable 
class. It does a good job of focusing on just one job and not doing to much
within the class. This class takes the alphabet and creates a Sprite for each
letter.

A possible change to the code that would affect this class is if we needed a
new or additional charachter to draw. The only thing that would be required to
do this is to add that character to the ALPHABET string in the factory. Adding
it here would allow for it to be added to the dictionary in the factory and 
could easily be accessed using the Singleton. This code is also very reusable
and would not need to be changed at all to be used in other programs.
