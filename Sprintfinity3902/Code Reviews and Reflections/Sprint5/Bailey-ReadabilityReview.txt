Reviewing empahsis: Readability

This sprint, Casey implemented a new Rope Snake enemy. The enemy is designed to dart towards
Link when Link enters his line of sight. This works great most of the time during runtime, 
although there is a little bit of variability in when the snake darts. Additionally, there is
a small bug where the snake may dart out of a doorway, thus out of the dungeon.

As for readability though, the class is set up very well. Magic numbers are all taken care of 
with descriptive names that make it easy to understand why they exist. Additionally, all variable
names make sense which greatly enhanses comprehension of the class.

There is really only one suggestion I might have for this class in the area of readability. The 
class is currently 155 lines long which is pretty long. It may be possible to move the ChangeDirection
method into the state pattern to decrease the lenghth.

When looking at the state pattern, there is a bit of confusion when looking at the titles of the
classes. They are quite long and hard to follow at first. Perhaps they could be consolidated a bit.
Although I first felt like they should be consolidated to fix this, I now see that with the rope 
snake enemy this might be necessary. Whether the snake is facing right or left deteremines which 
direction it will dart. Other than that, the states are similarly written in an understandable
way. There are a few variables set up that are never used that should be taken out.

Great work, Casey!
