Review:

Kyle's code here is totally readable. Well spaced and consistent. He didnt import anything he didnt need. 
My only piece of constructive criticism (that we've learned in class but that I would not give) is to keep
methods short (the setup method is long).

That's really all there is to say; the code is succint and quality. It would be professional with comments,
however, it's really easy to follow without them so it could be cluttered and at this point I'm being nit picky.
Again, the code is good 10/10.
