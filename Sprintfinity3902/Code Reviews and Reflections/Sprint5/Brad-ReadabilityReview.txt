Code Review
Readability on GohmaBoss.cs by Brad Knez
4/2/2021
Sprint 4
Code written by Bailey Ardrey 
Time Spent: 20 minutes

Quick notes on the class: 

Class starts by basic initialization, nothing unusal here.

Update is setting the sprite, telling it to useitem? 
Update is constantly setting the sprite to the current state's.
Updating, and moving.

Draw is our typical draw, do we need to set sprite if we're 
accessing the current state's sprite.

HitRegister checks to see if it was hit by an arrow, then it sets to 0.
This should be working with EnemyHealth and EnemyDamage, but I just added
these and probably should've fixed this myself.

Actual Readability Review:

Overall this class is not too differnet from any of our enemy classes.
It was pretty easy to understand what everything does and I wasn't confused
why some piece of code was there. My only issue would be I don't know what
UseItem does initially. After a quick look though this made sense since he uses
the fireball. Nice!

Overall this is a really easy to read class and makes sense within the context
of our game. Really cool to see how robust of an enemy we can create with 
our current setup. Nice job!
