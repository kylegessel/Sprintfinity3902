Reviewing empahsis: Maintainability

I believe this state pattern is implimented well. It is very effective and will
be easy to maintain. The door State classes are short and easy to impliment. In
the future if any states need to be added or removed, it will not mess up any 
of the other code. 


A couple suggestions I have for this class, is the Close method is never used. 
This method should be removed from all of teh state classes unless it has a 
future implimentation. Also, I believe that the enum values that live in the
DoorDirection class can be moved into an interface (probably the IDoor 
interface). This will allow for the DoorDirection class to be deleted.
