The gel enemy was one of the first enemies implemented in the game, and will be
ciritical in the upcoming sections when we start to implement collision and
interaction with link. Its a great example of an basic enemy as it is simple 
but has very unique movement pattern.

This implements the abstract entity class and overrides its movement. It also
adds a new movement method called moveSmoothly. Upon initial reading, its not
how these two methods are different. The reason they are different is that move
does an intialization/reset of important values and moveSmoothly actually moves
the entity.

I think this hurts the code's readability. Namely, the move function is
misleading as it doesn't move the slime at all! Only moveSmoothly moves the
slime. this is different from how move works in other entities.

Otherwise however, the code is very intuitive and easy to process. This is due
to the abstraction we have done with entity, allowing the slime code to be only
code specifically for this entity.

Because this is such an early implementation of an entity, I think a second
look might be a good idea, but overall it is very readable code!
