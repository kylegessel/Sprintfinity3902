This is definitely a complex class that has to do alot of things. The good
news is that the class is seperated into well-named functions. This helps with
readability immensely. As a class, it is definitely daunting to first look at.

Even within some functions, the code becomes hard to read. My example would be
StopAnimation. In StopAnimation you make changes to the position of every
entity based on an offset and set the doors. I am not sure how this stops the
animation.

Things like set link up position are very clear and very readable. Just a
simple function that completes one assigned task. Very easy to work with.

Things like offset are generally pretty readable, but of course (like lots of
this code) there are those large switch cases that hurt readability somewhat.

I think a good step would be to shrink some of the functions. Of course, a
refactoring could make this much more readable as well, replacing some of
logic here and placing it in its own class.
