Reviewing empahsis: Readability

Kyle did a great job writing the MiniMapHud class. Every variable has a 
descriptive name which aids in understanding what the code is doing.
Kyle is able to keep implementation details out of the MiniMapHud class
by utilizing other classes, some built specifically to house details
like initialization. This way, the class is not bogged down with walls
of code to set up the hud upon runtime. These two aspects of the code
together mean that there is no need for Kyle to write comments in the
code, becuase it is written in a way that is already readable and 
understandable.

Coming in at just over 100 lines, the class does a good job at staying 
short and containing only mini-map details. As a result, there aren't
any major changes I would recommend for the sake of readability. Perhaps
the only suggestion I might have if I was to nit pick, is that there is
a method to initialize location markers that might make a little more
sense in the initialization specific class. This could aid readability
because someone might expect that all initialization details would be
housed in the class of the same name, and not necessarily in a private 
method within the MiniMapHud itself.
