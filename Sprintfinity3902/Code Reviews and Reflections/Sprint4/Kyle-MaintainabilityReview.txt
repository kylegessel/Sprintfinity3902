The class is different from many of the other enemy and npc entity classes as
it integrates 3 entities into 1. The old man as well as the fire enemies are
all added within this one class.

The simplicity of the logic behind whether th fire's attack is great. I imagine
this is the reason that these entities were integrated together into a singular
class.

If the oldMan has been attacked, then the fires begin calling to their attack
function, which causes the fireballs to shoot.

Because the OldMan Sprite is the main sprite of the function, he is the only
entity in the room that has a hitbox, which is exactly how we want this entity
to behace.

Overall, the only issue with this code that I see, is that each fire in room 8
exists twice. The csv file builds fire entities so that link has a hitbox to be
hurt by when he walks in the room. But the fires the damage link when he walks
into them are NOT the same fires that attack link after link attacks the old
man.

Someone coming into this code blind may not expect that a based on the csv file
there would be 5 enemy entities in that room instead of 3. The csv shows 3 and
their eye would show three, however 5 are being built. If a user expects to
change the position of the fire in the csv file, they would not be able to
change where the fire's attack from, because that is instead dependent on the 
old man.

Changing this so that the fire entities are treated like goriya projectiles
MAY solve this issue of doubling the fire entities. This would allow them to
be added to the enemy list when the oldMan+FireEnemy is read by the csv. This
then allows us to permanently remove the fires from the csv while keeping
their hitboxes.s
