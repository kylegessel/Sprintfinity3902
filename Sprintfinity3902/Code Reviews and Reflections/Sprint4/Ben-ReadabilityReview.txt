Review:

Casey really nailed these interfaces: IAttack, IDoor, IBomb. He used composition of
interfaces to create a lengthy interface which was actually short in terms of lines of code. 
IAttack was used for FireAttacks. Casey also did not add accessor modifiers to his interfaces 
which has been a problem in this group, so there's another positive aspect of his code. IDoor
is a little more difficult to read simply due to the sheer size of it, but the length is
neccessary for the functionality of the code so this has to do more with the interface 
and not so mucn to do with Casey's ability to write concise code.

Although the interfaces are an important part of Casey's task, the true task was making our 
code more coded to interfaces, meaning our declared types were interfaces. This has helped
our group a bunch already, and we're excited about these changes. Personally, I'd like to
see IPlayer and ILink merge because quite frankly, I still don't understand why they're two
separate things, especially considering we use them the same way. Casey if you read this,
I challenge you to do this.

Finally, The DoorState interface also appears in IDoor and is also well written--I'm unsure who wrote
it. Anyways, Casey did a great job with these interfaces and I have no constructive criticism.
Well done m8.
