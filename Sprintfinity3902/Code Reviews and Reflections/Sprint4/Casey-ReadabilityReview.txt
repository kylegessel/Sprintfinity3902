Reviewing empahsis: Readability

The first thing I noticed about this class is its length. It is nearly 200 
lines. This imediatly makes it slightly difficult to read. A couple of my 
suggestions will help decrease the overall size of this class.

At the very begining of the InventoryHud class contains a private OrderedSet 
class. To help the readability of the InventoryHud class, the OrderedSet class
could be moved to its own file.

Also, The initialize method can be used to our HudInitializer class. All of our
other huds use this class to keep initialization logic out of the specific Huds
class. Moving these two things our of the InventoryHud class will help decrease
the class to close to 130 lines of code -- easier to read.

Throughout this class there are magic numbers. If these numbers had descriptive
names it would be much easier to read. The meaning of these nubmers would help
the reader understand what these calls are doing. For example, the 
initialization of iconMatrix uses multiple numbers that are not explained. In 
the iconMatrix initialization the lines of code are 264 characters long. This 
many things in one line of code can quickly become complicated and confusing to
the reader.

Finally, the naming convention for variables is not always consistent. This may
be the result of multiple people touching this code, but should be made more 
consistent. For example, if the variable ICON_MARGIN is all caps, the 
blackTileSquareWidth should probably also be all caps. 

Some things done well in this file to help make it readable is most variables
have very descriptive names. It is easy to determine the purpose of each 
variable.

Furthermore, other than Draw, all of the methods in this class are relatively 
short and have a single purpose. This makes it easy to follow what the goal of
each method in this code is doing. 

Overall, the InventoryHud was done pretty well. This class has a complex task
which makes it difficult to write in a readable manner. While there are small
changes that may help, nothing major needs to be changed in this class.
