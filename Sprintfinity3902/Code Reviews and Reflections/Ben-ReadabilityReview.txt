Review:

Brad did a great job writing this class! It's pretty easy to read. I'd recommend using ternary operators to condense two lines
of code that are exactly the same except for one expression as seen in the draw method. Additionally, a switch case might be easier on
the eyes in the draw method but I beleive this is preference and very subjective. The spacing looks organized, and consistent (which I care 
a lot about). The methods should all be consistent for spelling case if they're public (look at getUseItem again). @Brad please don't
be one of those programmers who indent their 'else' statements (line 85). Lines 86-93 could use some evaluating. The countUse variable
will be reset to 1 every time instead of 0 which is desirable. Maybe you could implement a reset method and throw a break in the else
statement. Moving the sword to -1000, -1000 is actually a pretty good idea insofar that you make sure the owner of this class destroys this object
as another precaution. Again, the UseItem function could benefit from ternary operator or a switch statement. Overall this is code I would 
write myself and be proud of; it looks clean and well written. My only other advice (which again is subjective) is maybe to add
a comment before each method giving a summary of its use. Great job.
