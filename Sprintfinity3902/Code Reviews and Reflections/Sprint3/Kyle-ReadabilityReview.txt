This part of the code along with Enemy Collision Handler work almost the same
way to accomplish handling of strictly colliding hitboxes.

The method names describe the function of the code very well, however the
nested if statements do make the code hard to read and understand upon first
look. I personally think this is just a consequence of complex code, but there
may to simplify this using object oriented strategies.

Overall it makes sense, you are trying to decide which direction to move the
offending entity based solely on how it interacts with other blocks. Thus you
HAVE to figure out which direction the overlap is in to appropriately displace
entity. You have to evaluate every scenario.

Once the direction of intersection is determined the enetity is shifted
appropriately. This section is clear.
