This code helps us form the basis of a player inventory system.

By giving each item a slot in a dictionary, we can simplify most of the 
inventory management in the future. Now we will be able to know exactly how
many items link has and whether he has them available to him. This also gives
us the basis for his health.

Both the pickup method and use item can have functions in the future that call
directly to the item class to determine what to do, possibly evading if
statements all together. This would be easily added to the current 
implementation.

This section of code will be critical during our next sprint and I think this
gives us a really solid starting point.
