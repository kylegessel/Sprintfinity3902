Sprint 3 Reflection

We are really proud of how Sprint 3 turned out. Its actually starting to look
and feel like a game! Many of the struggles we had in Sprint 1 we improved upon
and many of the things we did well stayed the same.

One thing we did we have done consistently well is communication and teamwork.
Last sprint was a great start for teamwork, but this sprint was even more
complicated. Many of the classes and tasks we had to accomplish had
dependencies between each other. This took extra coordination on our parts to
ensure each task was completed, but thanks to good communication we didn't
encounter many problems here.

During this sprint we struggled with time managment. We really worked on code
almost all the way up to the deadline. This is new to this team, sprint 2 was
completed almost a week in advance. Some reasons for the worse time management
was a slower first week of coding and personal sprint objectives that were too
ambitious. We hope that the extra implementations in THIS sprint will give us
more time in the next sprint to review code.

We had a massive improvement in our overall git skills. After the initial
learning curve of the first sprint, we had very few issues involving broken
master branches or version control. Many members even started to use more
advanced git methods like checking out branches and merging non master
branches.

Another improvement was a much cleaner project board. The tasks that had to
completed were outlined much earlier in this project than they were in the last
project. Furthermore, it was updated much more frequently. This led to a much
more streamlined design process.

We are excited to finish the game in the next sprint!
