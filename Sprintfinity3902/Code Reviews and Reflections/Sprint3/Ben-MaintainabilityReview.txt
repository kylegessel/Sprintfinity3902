Review:

Bailey wrote this class in such a way that it can be easily maintained. He made use of public get/set 
properties which help with code longevity. Additionally. Bailey made use of the Global class which 
means he did not hard code values into the class--this is a great and simple feature that goes a long 
way for maintaining code. The class is pretty simple; one suggestion might be to extract the repeated logic
in 67-105. Since the logic  is multi-line and repeated, it could shorten the class... however from a 
maintainabiltiy standpoint, Bailey's current implementation may be best so that he can change a specific
implementation for any of the repeated groups of entities. Bailey did a good job making this code 
maintainable. My hypothetical change would be to use ternary operators where appropriate.
