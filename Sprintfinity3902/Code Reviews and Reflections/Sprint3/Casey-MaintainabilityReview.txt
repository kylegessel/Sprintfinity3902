Reviewing empahsis: Maintainability

Overall, I think this class is very well written. Because of the abstract class
that it inherets from (AbstractEntity) it helps make this class less cluttered 
and minimal amount of things to implement. I think it will be easy to maintain
this class as we continue to improve and add to our code.

Two specific things quickly stick out to me that will help this code with 
maintainability. The first is the use of the Global variable SCALE. In the move
function, the distance moved is based on multiple things, one of which is this
SCALE variable. If in the future we are required to change the size of the 
game, this will only need to be changed in one location and will not mess up
the bats movements. The second thing I noticed is the use of the speed
variable. This is initialized when each bat is created and then is used to
determine movement distance as well as used in the function SetStepSize which
is needed for collision handling. If this was not initialized in one place, it
could become confusing in the move function and when handling collisions. 
Furthermore, the switch case makes it very easy if we need to add or take away
a moving direction for the bat in the future. Other than the move function, 
much of the properties and methods for the bat are stored in AbstractEntities. 
There are no big changes that I see that would be hard to maintain in this 
code.

A hypothetical change that could be made to this game is changing the speed of
the bats movements. If this were to happen, the only thing that would need to
change in this class is the speed variable initialized in the constructors. So
this class would handle that very well.
