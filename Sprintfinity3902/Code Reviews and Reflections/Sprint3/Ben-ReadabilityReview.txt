Review:

This code is adequately readable... I found some parts tough. Overall the code has good indentation
structure, however, braces are missing throughout the code. Sometimes these do help readability,
and it's subjective as to whether or not they do, but when they are compacted together between lines
122-125 it becomes a little more difficult to understand--this is why the indentation helps and steps in
for the braces. Also, some magic numbers are included which have no accompanying comment to explain them.
The indentation of braces matches what the group has unspokenly decided upon for formatting, and the methods
are spaced out evenly. The code looks pretty good overall, especially variable naming convention. I'm happy
with how it looks and don't think it needs further modification.
